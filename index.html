          <p>The journey began in June 1993 during the Latvian vocational education sports club "AMI" competitions in Cesis. The aim was clear - to promote athletic growth and strengthen bonds among students, educators, institutions, and management across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
          <br><br>Estonian and Lithuanian negotiations led to the inaugural Baltic States Sports Games in Riga in November 1993, featuring basketball and table tennis. Despite challenges, collaboration with the Ministry of Education and local institutes ensured the event's success, establishing an annual tradition. 
          <br><br>Fast forward to 2024 and the tradition lives on. XXIX Baltic Games will be hosted in the vibrant city of Tartu, Estonia, showcasing a variety of sports including basketball, volleyball, table tennis, and the unique school principals' triathlon. This marks a significant milestone in the event's history, as it has evolved from its humble beginnings in Cesis into a thriving legacy that symbolizes the enduring unity and sportsmanship of Baltic vocational education.</p>
